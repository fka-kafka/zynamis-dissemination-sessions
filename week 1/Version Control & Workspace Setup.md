**Git** is a **fast, scalable, distributed revision control system** with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

* It is the **core technology** that most modern version control platforms are built upon.
* Its **distributed** nature means every developer has a full copy of the entire repository's history, allowing for offline work and resilient data.

### 2. GitLab
